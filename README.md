# Customer Churn Analysis – Power BI Dashboard  

Customer churn is a critical challenge for businesses, particularly in highly competitive industries like telecommunications. This Power BI dashboard was developed to analyze churn trends for a fictional telecom company, Databel. The objective is to identify the key factors driving customer attrition and provide actionable insights to improve retention strategies.  

#### **Key Insights and Findings**  
1. **Overall Churn Rate:** The company has a churn rate of **26.86%**, which indicates a significant loss of customers. Understanding the root causes is essential for developing retention strategies.  
2. **Demographic Trends:**  
   - **Seniors (38.46%)** have the highest churn rate, followed by **Other (24.54%)** and **Under 30 (23%)**.  
   - A targeted approach based on age-specific needs and expectations can help reduce churn.  
3. **Contract Type & Payment Methods:**  
   - **Customers with monthly contracts** churn at a significantly higher rate than those with yearly or two-year contracts.  
   - **Paper check payments** are associated with higher churn, whereas direct debit and credit card users show more stability.  
4. **Customer Service Impact:**  
   - Customers who **frequently contact customer service** tend to have a higher churn rate, suggesting potential dissatisfaction.  
   - The average number of service calls per customer is **0.92**, with a total of **6,123 service calls** recorded.  
5. **Price Sensitivity:**  
   - The relationship between **monthly charges and churn rate** reveals that customers in certain pricing tiers are more likely to leave.  
   - A balance between competitive pricing and service quality is crucial to retention.  

#### **Technical Aspects & Skills Applied**  
- **Data Modeling & DAX Calculations:** Created calculated columns and measures to generate key metrics.  
- **Interactive Filtering & Slicing:** Used Power BI’s dynamic filtering capabilities to segment data by customer demographics, contract type, and service interactions.  
- **Data Visualization & Storytelling:** Designed a visually compelling and intuitive dashboard to present actionable insights.  

This project demonstrates the power of data analytics in understanding customer behavior and improving business strategies. By leveraging insights from this analysis, companies can implement targeted retention efforts, refine pricing strategies, and enhance customer service to minimize churn and maximize long-term customer value.
